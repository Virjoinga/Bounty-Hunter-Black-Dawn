CARLOS_TALK_01 = Black Dawn? A bunch of desperadoes.[n]Last contact I had with them I heard that they had just started research into biochemical weapons. [n]That was years ago, by now anything is possible. [n]The mutants you came across are probably the product of that research. You’d better destroy them right away.
CARLOS_TALK_02 = You help us to erase the biggest problem here, cant tell how to thank you.[n]What? You get some news from that deep abyss.[n]According to what you describe. It must be Spit.[n]You'd better to tell Murphy about this.
CARLOS_TALK_03 = Great! The hardest phase has been done. Then leave the next to us.
CARLOS_TALK_04 = Howard told you come here right? I need you help now.
GREEN_TALK_01 = Welcome, welcome, newcomer! Welcome to Sunset Strip![n]Looking for food? Weapons? Medicine? A man of taste such as yourself perhaps might be interested in magazines from the age gone by? Anything you may wish for, Green can help you procure…of course at the lowest prices around.[n]What's that you say? It looks like a slum around here? Ah, you must be from somewhere other than Muspel, no? My friend, this dwelling compares favorably to most of the residences in this area. At least here we can sleep through the night without having to worry about wild dogs or giant mutants like those poor people out in the wilderness.[n]Mithril deposits? Wish I knew![n]But, there are other opportunities available for armed men such as yourself. I…could make some introductions, if you'd like?[n]Speaking of which, I've run into some trouble lately myself. Perhaps you can help me sort it out?
JACK_TALK_01 = Sarah sent you, huh? How is she doing?[n]That silly girl... I always warned her to stay out of other people's business, but she always has to make trouble. Why won't she just leave that damn place? Maybe I should go pay her a visit…[n]And you, messing with the Black Dawn…you might get more than you were looking for. With people like that looking for you, you're not even safe here in White Night City…[n]That's right, they call this place White Night City. We lucked out and didn't take too much damage in the war. People from all over have made their way here, and the place is alive again, with the lanterns blazing night and day. That's why they call it White Night City, because the nights here are as bright as day. And in the middle of the barren wasteland that lies just outside the city, this here is the city of dreams.[n]Now, me, I'm a technician. I like experimenting with weapons and electronics. Of course, I like it more when people give me money in exchange for 'em.[n]Mithril deposits? I'm as fond of money as the next guy, but I don't believe a word of those rumors. Go ask somebody else.[n]By the way, I've been looking for somebody to help me out lately. Why don't you earn some real money first, then worry about finding your Mithril?
JACK_TALK_02 = Take this, it’s a Geiger counter I made. It’ll help you measure the radiation levels. Take it with you to the factory, and remember to bring the data back to me.
JACK_TALK_03 = I’m developing a device that’s harmless to humans but can drive off other dangerous creatures. When it’s done, humanity will be free of the dangers posed by mutants and other wild beasts. Do you know what an achievement that would be? I’ll go down in history! Of course, such a light bulb would require a special power source. According to my calculations, black crystal would work just perfectly. There’s a rich supply of them in the sewers. Go bring some back for me to test.
JOE_TALK_01 = Looking for some extra money? The Brave Joe definitely has the news you’re looking for. 
MURPHY_TALK_01 = This is a Monk Beast, very ferocious creature.[n]But this is no ordinary Monk, it's been enhanced with armor and some type of device.[n]I've never seen before.[n]You must tell Carlos about this and he will tell you what next.
MURPHY_TALK_02 = [0000ff]Jack[-] had you bring this over? Not bad, just my style. Maybe I should test it out on you?[n]Just kidding! Ha ha ha.[n]You're the guy who went head to head with the Black Dawn, aren't you? Not many people got your kind of guts. If you're everything the rumors say you are, we definitely have use for a guy like you![n]Mayor, Sheriff, Boss…whatever you wanna call me, remember this: Murphy's the man that runs White Night City.[n]Nobody dares to act up when old Murphy's around. But, in a big city like this, there are always places for rats to hide, and sometimes the come out and bite people.
MURPHY_TALK_04 = Just go!
SARAH_TALK_01 = Greetings, traveler. I am called Sarah. [n]I noticed you helped Green with certain business affairs.[n]It seems you're quite handy to have around…[n]I happen to be in the market for someone like you.[n]Me? No, I'm no one important.[n]This is a simple meeting place, not a mafia den or army headquarters…[n]As you can see, the rumors of Mithril have caused a great many young people to go off hoping to strike it rich.[n]And who could blame them? By now the only people left around here are women, children and the elderly. Life on Muspel is hard, and people need to band together to improve their lives.[n]I've been here for quite some time now, and have earned the trust and understanding of the people here, so they are all quite receptive to my advice. That's my role around here.[n]But anyhow, will you help me out? Of course, we will provide adequate compensation.[n]We are not rich, but we have our integrity.
LINDA_TALK_01 = We repaired the data card recovered from the lost scout. Seems like he was investigating something inside the base, and it may have been some new weapon.[n]Your performance has been excellent, no worse than any of our allied troops. That's why I've decided to let you join in a higher level operation."
LINDA_TALK_02 = R&D has produced a new assault rifle with the venom sac you brought back, way improved its armor piercing ability. We're looking for volunteers to take her out for a test drive!
LINDA_TALK_03 = We can't keep wasting our time repairing these radio towers day after day. [n]Go out and install these electromagnetic interference devices on the top of the towers, they should drive off anything that comes close.

Well, this place used to have a name, but now it's gone with all the people. Most of fools are moving to seek Mithril like you.[n]As for me, I'm too old, can't make it across the wilderness. And anyway, shiny stones are of no interest to an old man like me.[n]You can call me Woodman. No need to tell me your name, 'cause I don't care.[n]Don't you think you should concern yourself with your own affairs first?[n]It may not be like the frontier planets, with all them alien critters runnin' around, but Muspel sure isn't the safest of places either.[n]If I were you, I'd be more worried about getting food and clean water.[n]Ha ha, of course I do. But don't think I'm going to give it to you for free. Nothing comes for free here on Muspel.[n]Come along, maybe you can help me out with some things as payment.[n]Do you have a weapon? You can't survive here without something to defend yourself with.[n]Good, good…but don't go pointin' that thing at me, or you'll regret it![n]Ha ha, just kidding! I'm nothing but a frail old man.[n]Alright, now show me what you can do.

LOC_QUEST_3-15_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = Do you have any questions?
LOC_QUEST_3-15_FINISH = Officer Rex has already informed me. This is your reward.
REX_TALK_01 = Were you ambushed? They just waited for gains without pains. That's very low! [n]I thought it was a simple task. I never want to put you in danger. [n]Go to claim equipment from Linda as your reward.
LOC_QUEST_3-16_TITLE = The Past
LOC_QUEST_3-16_DESCRIBE_CARLOS = Local people used to worship the Gods in the Holy Temple. After the Federation colonized this place, the Holy Temple was abandoned. Later, the government built some installations there. I don't know what they are for. However, I think the Black Dawn would take advantage of them and get up to something. I hope you can go to investigate the rear palace of the Holy Temple.  
LOC_QUEST_3-16_DESCRIBE_01 = Go to the rear palace of the Holy Temple.
LOC_QUEST_3-16_DESCRIBE_02 = Collect information from the rear palace.
LOC_QUEST_3-16_HINT_01 = Perish the guardians there

LOC_QUEST_3-16_HINT_03 = Report to Carlos
LOC_QUEST_3-16_ACCEPT_QUEST = Those ancient ruins are good places to hide. We need to find them.
LOC_QUEST_3-16_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = Go and find Howard if you need any supplies!
LOC_QUEST_3-16_FINISH = Ion Cutting Machine? It seems that they already discovered the Energy Crystal Mine and planned to exploit it on a large scale. There must be a sinister plot behind.
LOC_QUEST_3-17_TITLE = Unstable Element
LOC_QUEST_3-17_DESCRIBE_LINDA = We already deciphered the Data Chip you brought back before. It's such a pity that we only found the communication log. There is nothing of any value in the log. However, it mentioned something about the Holy Temple Vault and something called "T" again and again. It may be a substance or an action code. We want you to go and investigate it.
LOC_QUEST_3-17_DESCRIBE_01 = Investigate the Holy Temple Vault.
LOC_QUEST_3-17_DESCRIBE_02 = Clear the vault.
LOC_QUEST_3-17_HINT_01 = Investigate the device in the vault

LOC_QUEST_3-17_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = I heard that Howard is researching on brand new drink. I am looking forward.
LOC_QUEST_3-17_FINISH = I have never seen this device before. It seems that we have to ask for help from the geeks in the lab.
LOC_QUEST_3-18_TITLE = The Bottomless Pit
LOC_QUEST_3-18_DESCRIBE_LINDA = Several days ago, a bottomless pit suddenly appeared near the Holy Temple. Officer Rex required a volunteer to investigate. Come on, there is a big reward in it.
LOC_QUEST_3-18_DESCRIBE_01 = Find and investigate the bottomless pit
LOC_QUEST_3-18_HINT_01 = Investigate the bottomless pit
LOC_QUEST_3-18_HINT_02 = Retreat and report to Rex
LOC_QUEST_3-18_ACCEPT_QUEST = According to the information received from our unmanned prober, we have reason to believe that the Black Dawn's recent actions have something to do with this pit.
LOC_QUEST_3-18_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = Do you need a rope?
LOC_QUEST_3-18_FINISH = We make sure that these pits are the entrances of the Energy Crystal Mine. The information you brought back is very important. I need to go back and consult with my people. I think that life is going to get a lot tougher for us. Anyway, it's a miracle that you survived and came back!
LOC_QUEST_3-19_TITLE = The Antigravity
LOC_QUEST_3-19_DESCRIBE_REX = According to the data we have deciphered, the Black Dawn must be manufacturing a Miniature Antigravity Device. We don't know what it is for yet. We are not sure about that "T" either. The information shows that they deposit some materials in the Federation's old warehouse. Go and have a close look, you need figure out what the Black Dawn is up to.
LOC_QUEST_3-19_DESCRIBE_01 = Locate the Federation's warehouse
LOC_QUEST_3-19_HINT_01 = Investigate the warehouse
LOC_QUEST_3-19_HINT_02 = Report to Linda

LOC_QUEST_3-19_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = Miniature Antigravity Device is very promising!
LOC_QUEST_3-19_FINISH = Rex asked me to wait for your reply. It seems that everything is going on well. [n]These are all parts to manufacture a Miniature Antigravity Device. We just need to assemble these semi-manufactures. [n]Carlos knows something about this device since his wheelchair was manufactured with a similar technology. [n] He may help you a lot.
LOC_QUEST_3-20_TITLE = Track the Technology
LOC_QUEST_3-20_DESCRIBE_CARLOS = When the antigravity field is generated, it will react with the planet's gravity field and release a special energy pulse. The pulse will ionize the air and continually release a special ion. Maybe we can find their hiding place by tracking the ion.
LOC_QUEST_3-20_DESCRIBE_01 = Locate the Ion trajectory [ff0000]<q>0<->[-]
LOC_QUEST_3-20_DESCRIBE_02 = Perish all enemies

LOC_QUEST_3-20_ACCEPT_QUEST = Hurry up. The ion won't stay long in the air.
LOC_QUEST_3-20_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = Everything you have done so far will be wasted if you don't act now!
LOC_QUEST_3-20_FINISH = It was technological revolution when they invented the antigravity device. Some real major changes have taken place in people's daily life. [n]The huge device at the very beginning was of limited use. The Federation Academy of Sciences made miniaturizing the device a top priority. [n]However, the work moved slowly. It seems that the Black Dawn is in the lead this time.
LOC_QUEST_3-21_TITLE = The Victorious Attack
LOC_QUEST_3-21_DESCRIBE_REX = The information says that the Black Dawn is secretly transporting something to the abandoned Federation's installation. It is safe to guess that they must be the Energy Crystals they have mined. Seek a way to find their Transport Team and destroy their goods.

LOC_QUEST_3-21_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = Hurry up. We can’t let those lunatics take charge of this dangerous resource.
LOC_QUEST_3-21_FINISH = Haha. Well done.
LOC_QUEST_3-22_TITLE = About "T"
LOC_QUEST_3-22_DESCRIBE_REX = According to the information we received, the Black Dawn is carrying out some experiments in the Holy Temple. The project code is "T". However, we know nothing about their experiments. That's not good. We need to hack into the host computer in their lab to get more information.
LOC_QUEST_3-22_DESCRIBE_01 = Sneak into the host computer room of the lab and shut down the electric generator.
LOC_QUEST_3-22_DESCRIBE_02 = Clear the lab
LOC_QUEST_3-22_HINT_01 = Shut down the electric generator

LOC_QUEST_3-22_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = We are close to the victory.
LOC_QUEST_3-22_FINISH = We can't read the data for the time being. We need more time.
LOC_QUEST_3-23_TITLE = The Underground Testing Field
LOC_QUEST_3-23_DESCRIBE_LINDA = Obviously, the Black Dawn started a new round of weapon research. It seems that those robots we destroyed last time were not their best ones! According to the information we intercepted, they are testing weapons near the Obelisk. Go there and see whether you can destroy their Testing Machine.
LOC_QUEST_3-23_DESCRIBE_01 = Clear the Obelisk nearby.
LOC_QUEST_3-23_DESCRIBE_02 = Receive the Navigation Chip
LOC_QUEST_3-23_HINT_01 = Perish all enemies
LOC_QUEST_3-23_HINT_02 = Pick up the Navigation Chip

LOC_QUEST_3-23_ACCEPT_QUEST = I am getting closer to the truth.
LOC_QUEST_3-23_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = It is said that the Obelisk has some kind of mysterious power.
LOC_QUEST_3-23_FINISH = I just sent you on a fool’s errand again. However, we really got something this time. I think we can find their real Test Base using this Navigation Chip.
LOC_QUEST_3-24_TITLE = The Threat
LOC_QUEST_3-24_DESCRIBE_REX = We read the data from the Navigation Chip and finally located their real Test Base. Now you should know what to do next.
LOC_QUEST_3-24_DESCRIBE_01 = Destroy the Black Dawn's brand new weapon.
LOC_QUEST_3-24_HINT_01 = Destroy FLOAT
LOC_QUEST_3-24_HINT_02 = Report to Rex

LOC_QUEST_3-24_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = What are you waiting for?
LOC_QUEST_3-24_FINISH = It seems that the Black Dawn really recruited some experts. I am not sure whether the Federation can research and develop such a weapon. We can't let down our guard in future. You perfectly accomplished your mission again. You won't miss your reward. I have to deal with some official business now. Dismiss.
LOC_QUEST_S3-12_TITLE = The Falling Star
LOC_QUEST_S3-12_DESCRIBE_HOWARD = A meteor crashed into the valley close to the Holy Temple recently. Although everyone knows the meteor is useless, the rich consider it fashionable to collect the fragments. Please go and search for it. You will receive a big reward.

I want to find some original materials to confirm my theories. However, I can't get close to the Holy Temple. That's why I need your help.
LOC_QUEST_S3-14_TITLE = Good Wine
LOC_QUEST_S3-14_DESCRIBE_HOWARD = There is an ode on the Inscription Rubbing, mentioning a method of making good wine. I would like to have a try. However, I need an important ingredient--the Spring Water of Holy Spring in the Holy Temple. Are you willing to go there again?

LOC_QUEST_S3-14_HINT_01 = Get the Holy Spring Water
LOC_QUEST_S3-14_HINT_02 = Deliver the Spring Water to Howard
LOC_QUEST_S3-14_ACCEPT_QUEST = I used ordinary purified water. How disappointing! I only got a load of horrible rubbish. No! Horrible poison!
LOC_QUEST_S3-14_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = What's wrong with this recipe?
LOC_QUEST_S3-14_FINISH = It would be the main selling point of my bar if I can successfully make that wine. I'll make a fortune! Don't worry. You'll get your proper share. Let's see, haha…
LOC_QUEST_S3-15_TITLE = Free Sample
LOC_QUEST_S3-15_DESCRIBE_CARLOS = Howard gave me these drink samples. He asked me to deliver them to chiefs in towns and get their feedback by the way. Since it is a bit difficult for me to walk, can you do me a favor? It is easy to earn some money.

LOC_QUEST_S3-17_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = 
LOC_QUEST_S3-17_FINISH = The Black Dawn caused the energy leakage when they pile up the Energy Crystals. It seems that they lost heavily, or you would be facing more enemies. You are so lucky.
LOC_QUEST_S3-18_TITLE = Catch the "Bird"
LOC_QUEST_S3-18_DESCRIBE_REX = I have to admit that the Black Dawn now have enormous technological potential. That's why it is important to research on their already-destroyed mechanical weapons.

LOC_QUEST_S3-20_ONTHEWAY_QUEST = Any news about Fox?
LOC_QUEST_S3-20_FINISH = I can't believe that Fox is a spy. I don’t know how many enemies are lurking in the Ironwall Fortress. We must double the guard.
LOC_QUEST_S3-21_TITLE = The Carrier
LOC_QUEST_S3-21_DESCRIBE_CARLOS = Rex said that you just fought a life-or-death struggle against a robot which used High Energy Crystals as its energy source. There might be some energy remnant on your body. We can extract it and research on how the Black Dawn transforms the energy.
LOC_QUEST_S3-21_DESCRIBE_01 = Talk to Linda to extract the sample.
LOC_QUEST_S3-21_HINT_01 = Talk to Linda to extract the sample
LOC_QUEST_S3-21_HINT_02 = Report to Carlos
